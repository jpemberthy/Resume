Such services included: the Uber OAuth2.0 provider, the external API backend service itself, a sandbox backend to let external developers and partners simulate real trip requests and a webhooks service to notify external developers of Uber events. These services are built on top of diverse tools like Python Flask, Python Tornado, Redis, MySQL, Kafka and the Go programming language.
\item Designed and developed the second generation of the Uber external API platform.
\item Developed a high level testing tool to guarantee consistency of the API endpoints in different environments: regular and sandbox. The tool makes usage of API blueprints specifications to describe the endpoints behavior and then performs requests against a given environment to make sure it satisfies the expected behavior. It was written as a node.js package.
